# Sorting Methods in JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in JavaScript. Each method provides a different approach to sorting elements in an array.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Example 1:

Bubble Sort with optimized flag. It uses a `do-while` loop to continue iterating until no more swaps are needed.

### Example 2:

Basic implementation of Bubble Sort using nested loops to compare and swap elements.

### Example 3:

Optimized Bubble Sort with a check to break out of the loop if no swaps are performed in a pass, improving efficiency.

Please add more examples as soon as you come across this repository.
